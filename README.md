# Divide & Conquer Algorithm Visualizer

A React web application that visually demonstrates Divide and Conquer algorithms with step-by-step execution.

## 🎯 Algorithms

- **Closest Pair of Points**: Finds the closest pair in 2D plane (O(n log n))
- **Karatsuba Multiplication**: Efficient large integer multiplication (O(n^1.585)) 

It is part of a **DAA (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) project**.  


## Features

- Generate sample input files automatically.  
- Step-by-step execution of algorithms.  
- Visualize intermediate steps to understand algorithm behavior.  
- Supports large datasets for both algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)  
- npm (v9+)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/divide-conquer-visualizer.git
cd divide-conquer-visualizer
````

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to use the visualizer.


## How to Use

1. Select the algorithm you want to visualize.
2. Generate 10 sample input files or use your own input file.
3. Click **Run Algorithm** to see results and step-by-step execution.
4. Optionally, download generated input files for offline testing.
